# PSI Numerical Methods 2026

This is sample code for the lesson on numerical integration.

The Python script may be run from the command line, it requires `numpy` and `matplotlib`.  If working with `uv`, you may run with `uv run integrate.py` and it will take care of the dependencies for you.

The script produces a convergence plot on the screen, and saves it to `convergence.png`
